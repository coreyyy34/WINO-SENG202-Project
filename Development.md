## To make changes follow these steps:

1. First create an issue
2. This issue will have an issue number at the top e.g seng202/team-6/issues/#1
3. create a branch off the development branch that starts with this numher

    **e.g** 1-test-branch
4. then when you are done work for a session, add, commit and push to this and create a new merge requst where you will **mark it as a draft so it can't be merged**
5. when it is ready to be merged into the development branch, it will be marked as not draft and the tag 'Ready for review' will be added
6. Happy coding!
